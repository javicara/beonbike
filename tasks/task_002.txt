# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Base Layout and Design System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational layout components and design system based on the specified color palette, typography, and UI requirements.
# Details:

3. Create base layout components:
   - Header with logo, navigation, language selector
   - Footer with contact info, social links, copyright
   - Main content container with responsive padding
4. Implement responsive breakpoints:
   - Mobile: 320px - 768px
   - Tablet: 769px - 1024px
   - Desktop: 1025px and above
5. Create UI component library:
   - Button variants (primary, secondary, CTA)
   - Card components for products and services
   - Navigation components (desktop and mobile)
6. Implement accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes using browser dev tools
2. Test color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards using accessibility tools
3. Validate component rendering in different browsers
4. Test keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
5. Verify font loading and fallback behavior
