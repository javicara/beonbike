# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize website performance with image optimization, code splitting, minification, and CDN integration.
# Details:
1. Implement Next.js Image component for all images with:
   - Proper sizing and responsive variants
   - WebP format with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
   - Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
   - Placeholder blurring for large images
2. Optimize font loading with:
   - Font display swap
   - Preload for critical fonts
   - Subset fonts to include only necessary characters
3. Implement code splitting and dynamic imports:
   - Use Next.js automatic code splitting
   - Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components
4. Configure caching strategy:
   - Set appropriate cache headers for static assets
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate strategy
5. Minimize CSS and JavaScript:
   - Use PurgeCSS with Tailwind to remove unused styles
   - Minify JavaScript with Terser
6. Implement critical CSS extraction
7. Configure CDN integration through Vercel or similar platform

# Test Strategy:
1. Run Lighthouse performance audits on all pages
2. Test Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)
3. Verify image optimization using browser dev tools
4. Measure Time to Interactive on mobile devices
5. Test loading performance on slow connections
6. Validate caching strategy effectiveness
7. Verify bundle sizes using build analytics
