# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize website performance with image optimization, code splitting, minification, and CDN integration.
# Details:
1. Implement Next.js Image component for all images with:
   - Proper sizing and responsive variants
   - WebP format with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
   - Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
   - Placeholder blurring for large images
2. Optimize font loading with:
   - Font display swap
   - Preload for critical fonts
   - Subset fonts to include only necessary characters
3. Implement code splitting and dynamic imports:
   - Use Next.js automatic code splitting
   - Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components
4. Configure caching strategy:
   - Set appropriate cache headers for static assets
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate strategy
5. Minimize CSS and JavaScript:
   - Use PurgeCSS with Tailwind to remove unused styles
   - Minify JavaScript with Terser
6. Implement critical CSS extraction
7. Configure CDN integration through Vercel or similar platform

# Test Strategy:
1. Run Lighthouse performance audits on all pages
2. Test Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)
3. Verify image optimization using browser dev tools
4. Measure Time to Interactive on mobile devices
5. Test loading performance on slow connections
6. Validate caching strategy effectiveness
7. Verify bundle sizes using build analytics

# Subtasks:
## 1. Image Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize all images by compressing, resizing, and converting to efficient formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, WebP). Implement lazy loading for non-critical images to reduce initial load times.
### Details:
Ensure images are not resized via CSS but are served at the correct dimensions. Use compression tools and consider next-gen formats for further optimization. Implement lazy loading to defer offscreen images.

## 2. Font Loading Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize font loading by minimizing the number of font files, using efficient formats, and implementing font-display strategies to avoid render-blocking.
### Details:
Subset fonts to include only used glyphs, use modern formats like WOFF2, and apply font-display: swap or similar CSS to improve perceived performance.

## 3. Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement code splitting and dynamic imports to load only the necessary JavaScript for each page or feature, reducing initial bundle size and improving load times.
### Details:
Use build tools or frameworks that support code splitting (e.g., Webpack, React.lazy) to break code into smaller chunks loaded on demand.

## 4. Caching Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and implement a caching strategy for static and dynamic assets to reduce server load and improve repeat visit performance.
### Details:
Leverage browser caching, set appropriate cache-control headers, and consider service workers for advanced caching of dynamic content.

## 5. CSS and JavaScript Minification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Minify CSS and JavaScript files to remove unnecessary characters, whitespace, and comments, reducing file sizes and improving load times.
### Details:
Use automated build tools to minify assets and bundle files where appropriate. Ensure minification does not break functionality.

## 6. CDN Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute static assets across geographically distributed servers, reducing latency and improving asset delivery speed.
### Details:
Configure CDN for all static assets (images, CSS, JS, fonts) and ensure cache invalidation strategies are in place for updates.
