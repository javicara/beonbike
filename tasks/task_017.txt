# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Accessibility Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance website accessibility to meet WCAG 2.1 standards with proper alt text, color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
# Details:
1. Add descriptive alt text to all images
2. Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards:
   - Text: minimum 4.5:1 ratio against background
   - Large text: minimum 3:1 ratio
   - UI components: minimum 3:1 ratio
3. Implement keyboard navigation:
   - Proper tab order
   - Focus indicators
   - Skip to content link
4. Add ARIA attributes where necessary:
   - aria-label
   - aria-describedby
   - aria-expanded
   - aria-hidden
5. Ensure proper heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
6. Implement form accessibility:
   - Associated labels
   - Error messages
   - Required field indicators
7. Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
8. Add language attributes to HTML elements

# Test Strategy:
1. Run automated accessibility tests using axe or similar tools
2. Test keyboard navigation on all pages
3. Verify screen reader compatibility
4. Check color contrast using WebAIM Contrast Checker
5. Validate form accessibility
6. Test with users who rely on assistive technologies if possible
7. Verify heading structure is logical

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Image Alt Text and Descriptions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add meaningful alt text to all images and provide extended descriptions where necessary to ensure non-text content is accessible to screen readers.
### Details:
Review all images across the site, ensuring each has descriptive alt attributes. For complex images (charts, infographics), provide detailed descriptions either inline or via linked content.

## 2. Verify and Enhance Color Contrast [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Check all text and interactive elements for sufficient color contrast according to WCAG AA standards and adjust styles as needed.
### Details:
Audit color contrast ratios using automated tools and manual checks. Update CSS to ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

## 3. Implement Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all interactive elements and navigation can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard.
### Details:
Test tab order, focus indicators, and keyboard shortcuts. Fix any elements that are not reachable or operable via keyboard, and ensure logical navigation flow.

## 4. Add ARIA Attributes Where Necessary [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.3
### Description: Apply appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to enhance accessibility for dynamic content and complex UI components.
### Details:
Identify components that require ARIA roles, states, or properties (e.g., modals, accordions, live regions). Add and test ARIA attributes to improve screen reader support without duplicating native semantics.

## 5. Enhance Form Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Improve the accessibility of all forms by ensuring proper labeling, error handling, and keyboard operability.
### Details:
Label all form fields, associate errors with inputs, provide clear instructions, and ensure forms are fully usable with assistive technologies and keyboard navigation.
